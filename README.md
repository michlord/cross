Cross - crossword editor
===

This is a simple crossword-editing program written in C and GTK+2.

I don't have time to write a readme for this but one thing to keep in mind
is that this program assumes all text files are encoded in 'cp1250'.
I hope I've saved you some head scratching by mentioning that ;)

If you want to test this program out you can download the .exe from /build directory.
It is an executable file that runs on windows.
